Stegosaurus
===========

Dinosaurs are cool.  Secrets are cool.  Secret Dinosaurs 
would be cooler.  Alas, Jurassic Park style shenanigans
are out of the scope of mere software, but we'll see what
we can do with the idea in the interim.

Usage
=====

Uh, well...

irb> require 'lib/waves'
irb> w = Waves.mono
irb> w.make_from('README')

Then go play README.wav in your favourite sound tool.  Yeah
a larger file would totally be more interesting.  But would
it be as secret?
